# Record Collection
This is a Record Collection demo application using Java, Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring JPA and Apache Maven.

I created this application for educational purposes, after I completed watching the online course on Udemy "Spring Core - Learning Spring Framework 4 and Spring Boot". The application is based on the examples used in this course.
