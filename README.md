# Record Collection
Record Collection is a demo application using Java, Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Thymeleaf and Apache Maven. I created this application in order to practice all of the above technologies, after I completed the online course on Udemy "Spring Core - Learning Spring Framework 4 and Spring Boot". The presented application in this repository is based on the examples used in this course.
